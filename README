and functions.  This distribution also contains C language bindings.

PostgreSQL has many language interfaces, many of which are listed here:

hardware platforms and contains information regarding any other
software packages that are required to build or run the PostgreSQL
system.  Copyright and license information can be found in the
file COPYRIGHT.  A comprehensive documentation set is included in this
